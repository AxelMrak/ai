## 📐 ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

- **ADR-001 – State**: [e.g., Zustand over Redux - lower overhead]
- **ADR-002 – CSS**: [e.g., Tailwind only, @apply in globals.css]
- **ADR-003 – Data**: [e.g., TanStack Query client, fetch server]

> Proposals conflicting with ADRs must name the conflict and ask before changing.

## 📝 Recent Changes

- **Skill Protocol Overhaul (2026-01-25)**: 
  - Rewrote AGENTS.md section 1.4 with comprehensive skill protocol
  - Added mandatory skill discovery (1% rule: if might apply, check index)
  - Added teaching detection (user says "siempre", "nunca", "regla" = create skill)
  - Updated `using-superpowers` skill for our system (meta-skill that teaches skill usage)
  
- **Skill Library Expansion (2026-01-25)**: Integrated 241 skills from `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`. Total skills: 249. Created `SKILL-INDEX.md` auto-generated index for agent discovery. Updated MANIFESTO with Skill Discovery Protocol (section 4.12).

- **Inter-Agent Awareness Protocol**: Added comprehensive rules for agents to recognize when another agent is better suited for a task and proactively suggest handoffs. Includes HEFESTO as production gatekeeper with final review responsibilities.

## 🪙 Token Mode

- **Mode A (Minimal)**: MEMORY.md + relevant files only
- **Mode B (RAG)**: Search + summarize + reason
- **Mode C (Deep Audit)**: Full module scan (rare, expensive)

Default to Mode A unless complexity requires more.
