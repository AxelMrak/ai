### RULE: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to Diagnose Slow Queries
(File: monitor-explain-analyze.md)

## Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to Diagnose Slow Queries

EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the query and shows actual timings, revealing the true performance bottlenecks.

**Incorrect (guessing at performance issues):**

```sql
-- Query is slow, but why?
select * from orders where customer_id = 123 and status = 'pending';
-- "It must be missing an index" - but which one?
```

**Correct (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE):**

```sql
explain (analyze, buffers, format text)
select * from orders where customer_id = 123 and status = 'pending';

-- Output reveals the issue:
-- Seq Scan on orders (cost=0.00..25000.00 rows=50 width=100) (actual time=0.015..450.123 rows=50 loops=1)
--   Filter: ((customer_id = 123) AND (status = 'pending'::text))
--   Rows Removed by Filter: 999950
--   Buffers: shared hit=5000 read=15000
-- Planning Time: 0.150 ms
-- Execution Time: 450.500 ms
```

Key things to look for:

```sql
-- Seq Scan on large tables = missing index
-- Rows Removed by Filter = poor selectivity or missing index
-- Buffers: read >> hit = data not cached, needs more memory
-- Nested Loop with high loops = consider different join strategy
-- Sort Method: external merge = work_mem too low
```

### RULE: Enable pg_stat_statements for Query Analysis
(File: monitor-pg-stat-statements.md)

## Enable pg_stat_statements for Query Analysis

pg_stat_statements tracks execution statistics for all queries, helping identify slow and frequent queries.

**Incorrect (no visibility into query patterns):**

```sql
-- Database is slow, but which queries are the problem?
-- No way to know without pg_stat_statements
```

**Correct (enable and query pg_stat_statements):**

```sql
-- Enable the extension
create extension if not exists pg_stat_statements;

-- Find slowest queries by total time
select
  calls,
  round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2) as total_time_ms,
  round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time_ms,
  query
from pg_stat_statements
order by total_exec_time desc
limit 10;

-- Find most frequent queries
select calls, query
from pg_stat_statements
order by calls desc
limit 10;

-- Reset statistics after optimization
select pg_stat_statements_reset();
```

Key metrics to monitor:

```sql
-- Queries with high mean time (candidates for optimization)
select query, mean_exec_time, calls
from pg_stat_statements
where mean_exec_time > 100  -- > 100ms average
order by mean_exec_time desc;
```

### RULE: Maintain Table Statistics with VACUUM and ANALYZE
(File: monitor-vacuum-analyze.md)

## Maintain Table Statistics with VACUUM and ANALYZE

Outdated statistics cause the query planner to make poor decisions. VACUUM reclaims space, ANALYZE updates statistics.

**Incorrect (stale statistics):**

```sql
-- Table has 1M rows but stats say 1000
-- Query planner chooses wrong strategy
explain select * from orders where status = 'pending';
-- Shows: Seq Scan (because stats show small table)
-- Actually: Index Scan would be much faster
```

**Correct (maintain fresh statistics):**

```sql
-- Manually analyze after large data changes
analyze orders;

-- Analyze specific columns used in WHERE clauses
analyze orders (status, created_at);

-- Check when tables were last analyzed
select
  relname,
  last_vacuum,
  last_autovacuum,
  last_analyze,
  last_autoanalyze
from pg_stat_user_tables
order by last_analyze nulls first;
```

Autovacuum tuning for busy tables:

```sql
-- Increase frequency for high-churn tables
alter table orders set (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05,     -- Vacuum at 5% dead tuples (default 20%)
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02     -- Analyze at 2% changes (default 10%)
);

-- Check autovacuum status
select * from pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
```
