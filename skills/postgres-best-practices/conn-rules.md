### RULE: Configure Idle Connection Timeouts
(File: conn-idle-timeout.md)

## Configure Idle Connection Timeouts

Idle connections waste resources. Configure timeouts to automatically reclaim them.

**Incorrect (connections held indefinitely):**

```sql
-- No timeout configured
show idle_in_transaction_session_timeout;  -- 0 (disabled)

-- Connections stay open forever, even when idle
select pid, state, state_change, query
from pg_stat_activity
where state = 'idle in transaction';
-- Shows transactions idle for hours, holding locks
```

**Correct (automatic cleanup of idle connections):**

```sql
-- Terminate connections idle in transaction after 30 seconds
alter system set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '30s';

-- Terminate completely idle connections after 10 minutes
alter system set idle_session_timeout = '10min';

-- Reload configuration
select pg_reload_conf();
```

For pooled connections, configure at the pooler level:

```ini
# pgbouncer.ini
server_idle_timeout = 60
client_idle_timeout = 300
```

### RULE: Set Appropriate Connection Limits
(File: conn-limits.md)

## Set Appropriate Connection Limits

Too many connections exhaust memory and degrade performance. Set limits based on available resources.

**Incorrect (unlimited or excessive connections):**

```sql
-- Default max_connections = 100, but often increased blindly
show max_connections;  -- 500 (way too high for 4GB RAM)

-- Each connection uses 1-3MB RAM
-- 500 connections * 2MB = 1GB just for connections!
-- Out of memory errors under load
```

**Correct (calculate based on resources):**

```sql
-- Formula: max_connections = (RAM in MB / 5MB per connection) - reserved
-- For 4GB RAM: (4096 / 5) - 10 = ~800 theoretical max
-- But practically, 100-200 is better for query performance

-- Recommended settings for 4GB RAM
alter system set max_connections = 100;

-- Also set work_mem appropriately
-- work_mem * max_connections should not exceed 25% of RAM
alter system set work_mem = '8MB';  -- 8MB * 100 = 800MB max
```

Monitor connection usage:

```sql
select count(*), state from pg_stat_activity group by state;
```

### RULE: Use Connection Pooling for All Applications
(File: conn-pooling.md)

## Use Connection Pooling for All Applications

Postgres connections are expensive (1-3MB RAM each). Without pooling, applications exhaust connections under load.

**Incorrect (new connection per request):**

```sql
-- Each request creates a new connection
-- Application code: db.connect() per request
-- Result: 500 concurrent users = 500 connections = crashed database

-- Check current connections
select count(*) from pg_stat_activity;  -- 487 connections!
```

**Correct (connection pooling):**

```sql
-- Use a pooler like PgBouncer between app and database
-- Application connects to pooler, pooler reuses a small pool to Postgres

-- Configure pool_size based on: (CPU cores * 2) + spindle_count
-- Example for 4 cores: pool_size = 10

-- Result: 500 concurrent users share 10 actual connections
select count(*) from pg_stat_activity;  -- 10 connections
```

Pool modes:

- **Transaction mode**: connection returned after each transaction (best for most apps)
- **Session mode**: connection held for entire session (needed for prepared statements, temp tables)

Reference: [Connection Pooling](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#connection-pooler)

### RULE: Use Prepared Statements Correctly with Pooling
(File: conn-prepared-statements.md)

## Use Prepared Statements Correctly with Pooling

Prepared statements are tied to individual database connections. In transaction-mode pooling, connections are shared, causing conflicts.

**Incorrect (named prepared statements with transaction pooling):**

```sql
-- Named prepared statement
prepare get_user as select * from users where id = $1;

-- In transaction mode pooling, next request may get different connection
execute get_user(123);
-- ERROR: prepared statement "get_user" does not exist
```

**Correct (use unnamed statements or session mode):**

```sql
-- Option 1: Use unnamed prepared statements (most ORMs do this automatically)
-- The query is prepared and executed in a single protocol message

-- Option 2: Deallocate after use in transaction mode
prepare get_user as select * from users where id = $1;
execute get_user(123);
deallocate get_user;

-- Option 3: Use session mode pooling (port 5432 vs 6543)
-- Connection is held for entire session, prepared statements persist
```

Check your driver settings:

```sql
-- Many drivers use prepared statements by default
-- Node.js pg: { prepare: false } to disable
-- JDBC: prepareThreshold=0 to disable
```
