### RULE: Use Advisory Locks for Application-Level Locking
(File: lock-advisory.md)

## Use Advisory Locks for Application-Level Locking

Advisory locks provide application-level coordination without requiring database rows to lock.

**Incorrect (creating rows just for locking):**

```sql
-- Creating dummy rows to lock on
create table resource_locks (
  resource_name text primary key
);

insert into resource_locks values ('report_generator');

-- Lock by selecting the row
select * from resource_locks where resource_name = 'report_generator' for update;
```

**Correct (advisory locks):**

```sql
-- Session-level advisory lock (released on disconnect or unlock)
select pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('report_generator'));
-- ... do exclusive work ...
select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('report_generator'));

-- Transaction-level lock (released on commit/rollback)
begin;
select pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('daily_report'));
-- ... do work ...
commit;  -- Lock automatically released
```

Try-lock for non-blocking operations:

```sql
-- Returns immediately with true/false instead of waiting
select pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext('resource_name'));

-- Use in application
if (acquired) {
  -- Do work
  select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('resource_name'));
} else {
  -- Skip or retry later
}
```

### RULE: Prevent Deadlocks with Consistent Lock Ordering
(File: lock-deadlock-prevention.md)

## Prevent Deadlocks with Consistent Lock Ordering

Deadlocks occur when transactions lock resources in different orders. Always
acquire locks in a consistent order.

**Incorrect (inconsistent lock ordering):**

```sql
-- Transaction A                    -- Transaction B
begin;                              begin;
update accounts                     update accounts
set balance = balance - 100         set balance = balance - 50
where id = 1;                       where id = 2;  -- B locks row 2

update accounts                     update accounts
set balance = balance + 100         set balance = balance + 50
where id = 2;  -- A waits for B     where id = 1;  -- B waits for A

-- DEADLOCK! Both waiting for each other
```

**Correct (lock rows in consistent order first):**

```sql
-- Explicitly acquire locks in ID order before updating
begin;
select * from accounts where id in (1, 2) order by id for update;

-- Now perform updates in any order - locks already held
update accounts set balance = balance - 100 where id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 100 where id = 2;
commit;
```

Alternative: use a single statement to update atomically:

```sql
-- Single statement acquires all locks atomically
begin;
update accounts
set balance = balance + case id
  when 1 then -100
  when 2 then 100
end
where id in (1, 2);
commit;
```

Detect deadlocks in logs:

```sql
-- Check for recent deadlocks
select * from pg_stat_database where deadlocks > 0;

-- Enable deadlock logging
set log_lock_waits = on;
set deadlock_timeout = '1s';
```

### RULE: Keep Transactions Short to Reduce Lock Contention
(File: lock-short-transactions.md)

## Keep Transactions Short to Reduce Lock Contention

Long-running transactions hold locks that block other queries. Keep transactions as short as possible.

**Incorrect (long transaction with external calls):**

```sql
begin;
select * from orders where id = 1 for update;  -- Lock acquired

-- Application makes HTTP call to payment API (2-5 seconds)
-- Other queries on this row are blocked!

update orders set status = 'paid' where id = 1;
commit;  -- Lock held for entire duration
```

**Correct (minimal transaction scope):**

```sql
-- Validate data and call APIs outside transaction
-- Application: response = await paymentAPI.charge(...)

-- Only hold lock for the actual update
begin;
update orders
set status = 'paid', payment_id = $1
where id = $2 and status = 'pending'
returning *;
commit;  -- Lock held for milliseconds
```

Use `statement_timeout` to prevent runaway transactions:

```sql
-- Abort queries running longer than 30 seconds
set statement_timeout = '30s';

-- Or per-session
set local statement_timeout = '5s';
```

### RULE: Use SKIP LOCKED for Non-Blocking Queue Processing
(File: lock-skip-locked.md)

## Use SKIP LOCKED for Non-Blocking Queue Processing

When multiple workers process a queue, SKIP LOCKED allows workers to process different rows without waiting.

**Incorrect (workers block each other):**

```sql
-- Worker 1 and Worker 2 both try to get next job
begin;
select * from jobs where status = 'pending' order by created_at limit 1 for update;
-- Worker 2 waits for Worker 1's lock to release!
```

**Correct (SKIP LOCKED for parallel processing):**

```sql
-- Each worker skips locked rows and gets the next available
begin;
select * from jobs
where status = 'pending'
order by created_at
limit 1
for update skip locked;

-- Worker 1 gets job 1, Worker 2 gets job 2 (no waiting)

update jobs set status = 'processing' where id = $1;
commit;
```

Complete queue pattern:

```sql
-- Atomic claim-and-update in one statement
update jobs
set status = 'processing', worker_id = $1, started_at = now()
where id = (
  select id from jobs
  where status = 'pending'
  order by created_at
  limit 1
  for update skip locked
)
returning *;
```
